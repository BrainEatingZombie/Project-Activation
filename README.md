# Project-Activation

This is going to be the first trial. The goal is to make a database system which keeps record of all the tasks done in a project. It includes a login system with some heirarchy. It will work like a spreadsheet. This is what is left of the previous work.
The project was done using mySQL and PHP. In the next version, I'm implementing MeteorJS.
